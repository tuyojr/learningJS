# ABOUT REPOSITORY

This repository contains all the code I wrote while learning JS with freeCodeCamp's [JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/), amongst their many other valuable [courses](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/).
